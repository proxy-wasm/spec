# WebAssembly for Proxies (ABI specification)

This repositarty contains specification of the low-level Application Binary Interface (ABI) and
conventions to use between L4/L7 proxies (and/or other host environments) and their extensions
delivered as WebAssembly modules.

The event-driven streaming APIs and convenient utility functions were originally developed for
the [WebAssembly in Envoy] project, but they are proxy-agnostic, and consumers can use the same
Proxy-Wasm extensions across different proxies.

## Implementations

### Host environments

* [Envoy / Istio Proxy]
* [ATS] (proof-of-concept)

### SDKs

* [C++]
* [Rust]
* [AssemblyScript]
* [TinyGo]
