# WebAssembly for Proxies (ABI specification)

This repository contains specification of the low-level Application Binary Interface (ABI) and
conventions to use between L4/L7 proxies (and/or other host environments) and their extensions
delivered as WebAssembly modules.

The event-driven streaming APIs and convenient utility functions were originally developed for
the [WebAssembly in Envoy] project, but they are proxy-agnostic, and consumers can use the same
Proxy-Wasm extensions across different proxies.
