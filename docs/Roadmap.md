# Proxy-Wasm Roadmap

The Proxy-Wasm community and maintainers envision an evolution path that has the
following tracks:

*   [Spec / ABI](#abi)
*   [SDKs / language support](#sdks)
*   [Host features](#host)
*   [Envoy integration](#envoy)

Each track is described in more detail below, with owners and ETAs listed for
efforts currently in development. This roadmap should not be construed as a set
of commitments, but rather a set of directions that are subject to change in
response to community interest and contributions.

The overarching goals of this document are to:

*   Publish areas of current investment.
*   Encourage external contributors by pointing out feature gaps.
*   Align this repository with the vision of WebAssembly: a portable technology
    that is cross-language, cross-platform, and cross-provider.

## Spec / ABI

*   (Q1'25: @piotrsikora, @mpwarres) Publish ABI v0.3, containing at least:
    *   Feature negotiation (proxy-wasm/spec#71 and proxy-wasm/spec#56)
    *   Better header/body buffering support (proxy-wasm/spec#63)
    *   Async shared data (proxy-wasm/spec#54)
    *   Repeated header support (proxy-wasm/spec#53)
*   (Help wanted) WASI convergence. We want to adopt the component model at WASI
    1.0. There is a lot of overlap between Proxy-Wasm and some WASI proposals
    ([wasi-http](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http),
    [wasi-keyvalue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue), etc). In the
    short term, we'd like to define the Proxy-Wasm ABI in
    [WIT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md),
    to understand:
    *   How do
        [Proxy-Wasm interfaces](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-host/blob/main/include/proxy-wasm/context_interface.h)
        map to components?
    *   What are the API gaps? How should we evolve Proxy-Wasm to become
        WASI-compatible? What are good incremental steps?
    *   Are there any performance gaps?
*   (Help wanted) Evaluate uses of foreign functions to identify feature gaps.
    *   For example, Envoy
        [registers foreign functions](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aenvoyproxy%2Fenvoy%20RegisterForeignFunction&type=code)
        for signature checking, compression, filter state, route cache, and CEL
        expressions.
    *   Are there similar extensions in Nginx? Apache Traffic Server?
    *   Which of these features should be promoted to ABI interfaces?

## SDKs / language support

*   (Q1'25: @leonm1) Fork the abandoned Go SDK + support full Golang.
*   (Google exploring) Build a Python SDK using a MicroPython port.
*   (Help wanted) Stop using Emscripten in the C++ SDK. Instead use Clang /
    wasi-sdk (proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk#167).
*   (Help wanted) Merge LeakSignal's
    [proxy-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/proxy-sdk) crate into the Rust SDK.
*   (Help wanted) Build a Lua SDK using a Lua interpreter.
    *   Seems quite feasible given projects like
        [wasm_lua](https://github.com/vvanders/wasm_lua).
    *   Could replace Envoy's
        [Lua filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/lua_filter)
    *   Could benefit NGINX's Lua-based [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/)
        ecosystem
*   (Help wanted) Optimize Rust SDK binary size. It seems compiler dead-code
    elimination is thwarted by the use of Context traits.

## Host features

*   (Q1'25: @mpwarres) CppHost maintenance.
    *   Update v8 and upstream some patches for v8 warming / extension.
    *   Update the protobuf dependency.
    *   Set up dependabot.
*   (Help wanted) Prototype
    [HyperLight](https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight) as a KVM-based
    sandboxing layer around wasm runtimes. The allure is getting an inexpensive
    and transparent second layer of security at a thread boundary, which makes
    it more feasible to run fully untrusted workloads with Proxy-Wasm.
*   (Help wanted) Performance benchmarks. One of Proxy-Wasm's strengths is its
    ability to swap between multiple wasm runtimes. Help users make an informed
    decision by benchmarking cold start and execution costs across runtimes.
*   (Help wanted) Adopt CPU metering as a first-class feature. Leverage
    instruction counting where available. For other engines (e.g. v8), use a
    watchdog thread.
*   (Help wanted) Support dynamic (per VM) limits for RAM and CPU.
*   (Help wanted) Expand the use of SharedArrayBuffer to reduce memcpy into wasm
    runtimes. This is especially promising for HTTP body chunks. See relevant
    [WASI issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/594). Also reduce
    [binary memcpy](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-host/blob/21a5b089f136712f74bfa03cde43ae8d82e066b6/src/v8/v8.cc#L272).
*   (Help wanted) Implement NullVM for Rust and/or Go. For proxy owners with
    trusted extensions, achieve native performance while maintaining
    WebAssembly's portability.
*   (Help wanted) Finish the implementation of DynVM
    (proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-host#379). This allows dynamic loading of trusted
    (NullVm) wasm modules.

## Envoy integration

*   (Q1'25: @mpwarres, @botengyao) Get Envoy's inline wasm filter out of alpha
    (envoyproxy/envoy#36996). Documentation, security scanning, tests, bug
    fixes, etc.
*   (TBD: @mpwarres) Implement the v0.3 Proxy-Wasm ABI.
*   (Help wanted) Decouple from the thread-local execution model. As wasm
    modules become more CPU intensive and leverage multiple async APIs, consider
    managing a separate Proxy-Wasm threadpool. Each VM needs a work queue, and
    requests need affinity to a single VM. This architecture allows for
    independent thread scaling (expensive wasms get more CPU), improved
    parallelism (multiple requests' wasm at the same time), and reduced memory
    costs (one VM serves multiple Envoy threads).
*   (Help wanted) Envoy has a single implementation for the entire Proxy-Wasm
    host. Add extension points for different Proxy-Wasm interfaces (telemetry,
    network calls, key value, shared queue), so that Envoy operators may provide
    their own implementations.
